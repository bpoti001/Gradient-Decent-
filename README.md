# Gradient-Descent
sgd
Implted SGD for linear regression with cost function 



![Alt Text](https://github.com/bpoti001/Gradient-Descent/blob/master/math_f_1.PNG)

Which on applying differentiation 
```
prediction = np.dot(X,w)
err = (prediction -Y)*X
```

The Code is availabe in the [ALGO](https://github.com/bpoti001/Gradient-Descent/tree/master/algo) Directory 
The [Batch_GD_1](https://github.com/bpoti001/Gradient-Descent/blob/master/algo/batch_gd_1.py) file does batch gradient decent for 3 parameters. 


File [Batch_GD_2](https://github.com/bpoti001/Gradient-Descent/blob/master/algo/batch_gd_2.py),does same thing but coded using vector representation.
